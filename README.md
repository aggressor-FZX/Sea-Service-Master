This is a GUI that generates Sea service Letters in DOCX format. It reads in a spread sheet data to populate items on the GUI. The user then must then choose the type of letter to create and make moddifications then the GUI will Create a sea service letter with NOAA letter head and a signiture block for signing. It was made in PyQT and makes a cool GUI interface that shows you stuff before it writes the letter.

This only works with a spreadsheet with the heading and columns that are desinged for the python program and Pandas sdk instructions in the code base. In other words you need to know how to write the spread sheet for the 
program to get the information correctly.
